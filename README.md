# rmdup
Simple tool for removing duplicate files

# Usage 
```rmdup <file.txt>```  
You just pass a file and it will scan the Current Working Directory for files that have the same [BLAKE3](https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3) hash.

This tool is likely to get even more functionality in the future. If you'd like to have a feature added, just open a new Issue.
